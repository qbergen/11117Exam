Problems: 
Loading images, I wasn't getting an image. I knew I was getting a response back because my text was showing in the displayed color
so I logged the responses for the URl and realized that it was without the baseURL so I made a final variable to hold
the base and then just added it to the URL. 
My next bigger problem was the recView. I had difficulty putting everything inside of it. it was one of thsoe scenarios where
I just didn't know what piece of the puzzle goes where so you just jam a few pieces in and hope that the IDE likes your personality.
It was pretty cool, looking at all of the APP from scratches this one was by far my best despite not meeting the requirements.
It's a crazy feeling not know what the heck is going on and then using whatever logic in your head to fix it and it works.
I also had a few instances where I would code for 10 minutes RUN and it worked on the first try.
